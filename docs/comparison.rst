There are numerous modeling and simulation tools for ABMs,
each with their own particular focus and style
(find an overview `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_agent-based_modeling_software>`_).
The three main distinguishing features of agentpy are the following:

- Agentpy integrates the multiple tasks of agent-based modeling
  - model design, interactive simulations,
  numerical experiments, and data analysis - within a single environment
  and is optimized for interactive computing with IPython and Jupyter.
- Agentpy is designed for scientific use with experiments over multiple runs.
  It provides tools for parameter sampling (similar to NetLogo's BehaviorSpace),
  Monte Carlo experiments, stochastic processes, parallel computing,
  and sensitivity analysis.
- Agentpy is written in Python, one of the worldâ€™s most popular
  programming languages that offers a vast number of tools and libraries for scientific use.
  It is further designed for compatibility with established packages like
  numpy, scipy, networkx, pandas, ema_workbench, seaborn, and SALib.

The main alternative to agentpy in Python is `Mesa <https://mesa.readthedocs.io/>`__.
To allow for an comparison of the syntax,
here are two examples for a simple model of wealth transfer,
both of which realize exactly the same operations.
More information on the two models can be found in the documentation
of each framework (:doc:`Agentpy <agentpy_wealth_transfer>` &
`Mesa <https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/intro_tutorial.html#tutorial-description>`_).
