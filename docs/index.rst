    \chapter{Introduction}

Agentpy is a package for the development and analysis of agent-based models in Python. The project is still in an early stage of development. If you need help or want to contribute, feel free to write me via joel.foramitti@uab.cat.

.. rubric:: Main features

- Design of agent-based models with complex procedures.
- Creation of custom agent types, environments, and networks.
- Container classes for operations on groups of agents and environments.
- Experiments with repeated iterations, large parameter samples, and distinct scenarios.
- Output data that can be saved, loaded, and transformed for further analysis.
- Tools for sensitivity analysis, interactive output, animations, and plots.

    .. rubric:: Alternatives
    
    There are numerous other frameworks for agent-based modeling, each with their own focus and advantages. An overview can be found in `Abar et al. (2017) <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cosrev.2017.03.001>`_. The main alternative to agentpy in Python is `Mesa <https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_, which could be more suited for users who are looking for a stronger similarity to Netlogo with spacial simulations and live visualization.
