Agentpy is an open-source framework for the development and analysis of
agent-based models in Python. If you have feedback, need help, or want to contribute,
please write to joel.foramitti@uab.cat.

**Main features:**

*Aim 1:* Intelligent syntax for complex models

- Custom agent, environment, and network types
- Easy selection and manipulation of agent groups
- Support of multiple environments for interaction

*Aim 2:* Advanced tools for scientific applications

- Experiments with repeated iterations and parallel processing
- Parameter sampling and scenario comparison
- Output data that can be saved, loaded, and re-arranged
- Sensitivity analysis and (animated) visualizations

*Aim 3:* Compatibility with established Python libraries

- Data analysis with pandas and SALib
- Statistical visualization with seaborn
- Networks and graphs with networkx
- Interactive output with IPython
